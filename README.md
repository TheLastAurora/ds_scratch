# **Data Science from Scratch - Exercises and Plots**

This repository is my personal take on Data Science from the book "Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python - 2nd Edition" authored by Joel Grus. Although familiar with some of its core concepts, I'm a beginner, so here you'll find a small collection of exercises and some of the corresponding plots to chapters and topics he covers. Lastly, I want to thank the author for the excellent job and the contents of this book and highly recommend this as a introductory material on the Data Science field.

## Purpose of This Repository

The primary objectives of this repository are:

- Personal Learning Journey: This repository captures my journey of learning Data Scienceprinciples using the book as a guide. By working on exercises and creating visualrepresentations of the concepts, I aim to solidify my understanding and gain hands-onexperience.
- Hands-on Application: The exercises provided here allow me to apply the theoretical knowledge gained from the book to practical scenarios. This hands-on approach enhances my comprehension of the subject matter.
- Visual Learning: I've included a collection of plots to visually represent the data analysis and visualization techniques presented in the book. These plots help me grasp complex concepts more intuitively and showcase my progress.
- Personal Reference: As I work through the exercises and create plots, this repository becomes a personalized reference that I can revisit whenever I need to review specific concepts or techniques.
